# Music Paint

This is a little web audio experiment where you can paint music. [Demo](https://terabaud.github.io/music-paint)

Every stroke makes some noise. Either sine, square, triangle, sawtooth or white noise. 

It has some cool features:

 * Unlimited canvas, (use the right mouse button to explore the canvas, or switch to move mode to move around)
 * Multi-touch is supported
 * Shake your phone to start over
 * Thanks to Web MIDI API, you can connect a MIDI device and make some noise :)
 * Or you can just use the keyboard
 * Save your work as an SVG file and reopen it for later use ☺ 

Limitations:
 
 * every tone is like a function (x) => y (only one y per x). 
 
PS: Special thanks to my testers: My nieces (ages 4 and 7) had a lot of fun playing with it ☺
